# Security Policy

## How to not report a potential security vulnerability
If you find a potential security vulnerability in EyeYouReadyForit, please do **not** create an issue. This could lead to the vulnerability being leaked and exploited until it is fixed.  
You should also refrain from letting others know about it until resolved, or exploit it yourself with the intention to harm others or the normal functioning of the bot.   
Vulnerabilities that only apply to a self-hosted version or modified fork of the bot are considered out of scope.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
To report a potential security vulnerability, please DM `heftymouse#2876` and `BoogieMonster1O1#1989` on Discord about it.  
You should expect a reply within a day. We will work to fix the issue as soon as possible and credit you on this page.
